# 🍣 Infinite Sushi Slider

The Infinite Sushi Slider is a fun, interactive app that lets you play with a never-ending sushi roll. Click on a slice to remove it, and watch as a new one appears, keeping the sushi roll infinite. This project was created just for fun and because I had a craving for sushi!
